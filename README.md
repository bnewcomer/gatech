The Personal Authentication System, a prototype distributed authentication provider meant to solve the problem of centralized sensitive data stores.

- processor-design

A set of projects building up to the design and implementation of a full pipelined processor using Verilog and implementing a minimal instruction set.

- transport-protocol

A library implementing a simple reliable connection-oriented transport protocol using python. Also includes client and server scripts for demonstrating the protocol implementation.

- yearup-teaching-material

Teaching material from a class teaching web development as an introdcution to programming. I taught four classes and helped coordinate the rest of the 15 week program.
